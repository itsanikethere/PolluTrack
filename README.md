# 🌍 PolluTrack

PolluTrack is a simple Java Swing application that helps you track air pollution levels in your area. The application
uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch AQI (Air Quality Index) data based on your location, which can be specified by
latitude and longitude. The application also preserves your location preferences so that you don't have to enter it
every time you use the app.

## 🚀 Features

- Fetch AQI data based on your latitude and longitude
- Save your location preferences for future use
- Simple and intuitive user interface using Java Swing

## ❔ How to use PolluTrack

1. Download the PolluTrack jar file and double-click to run the application
2. Enter latitude and longitude and click "Fetch" to retrieve AQI data
3. The AQI data will be displayed in the application and can be refreshed at any time

## 💻 Requirements
